# IBM i Modernization Labs 101 - Getting Started with Bob

## Overview

Six hands-on labs to learn IBM i modernization using IBM Bob AI assistant. Each lab focuses on one practical use case you can complete quickly.

The application SAMCO is a simple order management system. It has a green screen interface and RPG code that is over 20 years old. It is a good example of a system that could benefit from modernization on the IBM i platform! 

For essential concepts and best practices when using IBM Bob for IBM i modernization, see the [Bob Concepts & Best Practices](./bob-concepts-and-best-practices.md) guide.

## 🏗️ Building and Testing SAMCO on IBM i

Want to build and test the actual green screen SAMCO application on your IBM i system? Follow these steps.

Draft documentation: Build with vscode not documented yet. Dependency management is done via Tobi is not 100% documented yet, but the application can compile and will be functional: some programs may not work due to missing dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- IBM i system (7.3 or higher recommended)
- IBM Bob with [Code for IBM i](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HalcyonTechLtd.code-for-ibmi) extension + other related extensions.
- SSH access to IBM i
- User profile with appropriate authorities 
- [Tobi](https://ibm.github.io/ibmi-tobi/#/) build tool installed: `/QOpenSys/pkgs/bin/makei`

### Building the Application

**1. Install Tobi on IBM i** (if not already installed):
```bash
# SSH to your IBM i system
yum install ibmi-tobi
```

**2. Optional - Configure VS Code Connection:**
- Install "Code for IBM i" extension in IBM Bob / vscode
- Press `F1` → "IBM i: New Connection"
- Enter your IBM i hostname, username, and password
- Connect to your system

**3. Create Target Library:**

```bash
# Create target library 
CRTLIB LIB(SAMCO) TEXT('SAMCO Application')
```
or
```bash
# In IBM i PASE (shell) 
system "CRTLIB LIB(SAMCO) TEXT('SAMCO Application')"
```
**4. Clone and Open Project:**
```bash
# In Bob terminal / shell on IBM i
cd /home/YOURUSER
git clone https://github.com/bmarolleau/IBM-i-Application-Modernization-with-Bob
cd IBM-i-Application-Modernization-with-Bob/SAMCO
```

**5. Build the application**
```bash
# SSH to IBM i
cd /home/YOURUSER/IBM-i-Application-Modernization-with-Bob/SAMCO
export lib1=SAMCO
system "addlible SAMCO"
/QOpenSys/pkgs/bin/makei build
```

The build process compiles all source types: RPG, COBOL, CL, DDS, SQL, etc.

**5. Populate Db2 tables**

Use [SAMCO/POPULATE_SAMCO_TABLES.sql](./SAMCO/POPULATE_SAMCO_TABLES.sql) to populate the tables with sample data. You can run this from the IBM i Navigator or from the IBM i Access Client Solutions.

### Testing the Green Screen Application

**1. Start a 5250 Session:**
- Use your preferred 5250 emulator (ACS, TN5250, etc.)
- Sign in to your IBM i system

**2. Set Library List:**
```
ADDLIBLE LIB(SAMCO)
```

**3. Run Key Programs:**

| Program | Description | Command |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `SAMMNU` | SAMCO Main Menu | `GO SAMCO/SAMMNU` |
| `ART200` | Work with Articles | `CALL SAMCO/ART200` |
| `ORD200` | Work with Orders | `CALL SAMCO/ORD200` |
| `CUS200` | Work with Customers | `CALL SAMCO/CUS200` |

**4. Navigate the Interface:**
- Use function keys (F3=Exit, F5=Refresh, F6=Add, etc.)
- Test CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Explore the subfile displays

### Quick Reference

```bash
# Build entire project
/QOpenSys/pkgs/bin/makei build

# Build specific component
/QOpenSys/pkgs/bin/makei c -f QRPGLESRC/ART200.PGM.SQLRPGLE

# Clean build artifacts
/QOpenSys/pkgs/bin/makei clean
```

**Next Steps:** Once the green screen app is running, try the modernization labs to see how Bob can help transform it into a modern web application!
